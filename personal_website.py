                in a mouse's lifecycle. These G-protein knockout mice are research analogs for pancreatic cancer found in human. Gna15 is a G-protein coupled receptor

                play an important role in a distinct mechanism for early pancreatic carcinogenisis.

        His career passion started in science with a desire to help others through research. While he still is a science enthusiast 
        his interests began to migrate into tech after deciding to follow a desire to learn how to program.
        Silvano possesses strong analytical skills through past research, healthcare and clinical diagnostic roles centered around improving
        health outcomes for others.
        
        He prides himself in being an enthusiastic learner and avid coder. At the beginning of his career he was a chef
        and worked in the catering industry. While earning his Bachelor's of Science in biochemistry through the 
        University of Washington (UW) he joined a neuroscience research lab. Here he practiced analysis within the scope of research
        and took on an independent project management role. After he concluded his independent experiments and was part of a team to publish in 
        a high impact scientific journal he decided to explore the world of healthcare. Silvano has a personal tie to health care and wanted
        to be an asset in this community. His mother was cured of stage four melanoma and he wants to give back to the world that allowed her to stay in his life. He joined 
        Bloodworks Northwest initially as a phlebotomist, but quickly found his way back into the laboratory space when a 
        job opened up in the histocompatibility laboratory. 
        
        His current role uses a SQL coded database and practices heavy analysis and review on data for clinical patients in need of solid organs and other specialty diagnostics. 
        The heavy use of data analysis in both the research and clinical settings ultimately sparked an interest in learning how to program and use databases to improve the 
        quality of life for others. Silvano first took introductory courses in programming and 
        relational databases in SQL. Eventually, he enrolled in a certificate program in financial technology to enhance his python programming skills
        and develop foundational knowledge in machine learning. 
        
        Going forward he wants to pursue a career in tech as a Data Scientist and has been accepted into the Data Science certificate program
        offered through UW and the Master's of Science in Information Management program with a specialization in Data Science at UW as well.
